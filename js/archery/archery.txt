> Show points of each region on the region. Make the speed 3 rotation per second.

The points should be between 1 and 5. Make speed 180 rpm. Show the point assigned for each region on the region.

The region should look like a pie chart as you did before. Choose these colors and points: green = 1, blue = 2, white = 3, red = 4, yellow = 5. Show the points properly on the region. ALso implement the speed (180 rpm) correctly.

I want the user to be able to create a list of products. The columns "product_id","Name","Unit_Price","Unit".

In another app they can choose products from dropdown and write amount and then total price will be automatically calculated. Then they can print the summary as pdf.

First app,

* Give the title: Add New Product
* Save when "Add Product" is clicked. Don't keep a separate Save button.
* Don't keep default value for unit price or any variable.
* Show previous values on the table by default.
* Don't allow adding duplicate product id
* After a product is added, reset all boxes
* keep an edit option to edit product info
* Keep inpuxt boxes empty before input.
* Do this for edit. When edit in a row is clicked, load all the fields in input box. Don't ask for confirmation. It can be then added like new products.
* For delete option, user can write product id in a another area, then click on delete
to delete it.
* Select product id automatically. It is the next integer in product id. So don't show this input box. Just ad it silently.
* Don't show decimal in product_id. Show full integer
* If any product is deleted, a product is missing. So to add new product id, search if any integer is missing between min and max, if misisng, start adding the missing ones

App 2

Show unit after product is selected. Also add option for adding a new product. Show
it below the previous product. If it is clicked, the input boxes are reset. Also show total price in the bottom of the table.

* Remove New Product button. If a product is added, the input boxes are reset.
Show the summary on the right, not below, as now.

* Total price is mentioned twice. Also one which shows calculated price is not properly aligned. It's hidden by table header.

* Show taka sign instead of dollar. Keep Total Price within table margin, not to the right.

* Let the user print the summary table.

* Print only price summary. Remove product selection option outside print area

I want to print only the summary part. The Product Selection
 option in the left sidebar should be omitted from print option. When print is clicked, only the summary, starting from Selected Products:
 to the Total Price and all products info should be printed. Help me achieve it.
